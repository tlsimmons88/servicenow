 Business rule "SNC CMDB Category" would run when the current category value is nil on the "cmdb_ci" records. If it is nill, it would query for "cmdb_categories" table and update the category accordingly when there is an insert or update on the CI. But if there is no record in the cmdb_categories table for "x" class then category and subcategory do not get set
