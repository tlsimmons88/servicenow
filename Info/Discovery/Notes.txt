Phases - General
	Identification
		Shazam probe returns open ports
			Shazam sensor parses the returned data to figure out open ports
				Run classifier probes for open ports
					Classifier probes returns device class
						Classifier sensor runs to figure out which identifier probes to run
							Run Identity Multi Probe
								Identity Multi Sensor pares the data returned from the device
									Sends the results to the identifier
										Identifier quires the CMDB to see if there is a matching device
	Exploration
		Launches Multi Probe Exploration probes based on the results from the identification phase

	CI Identified
		Run Active Process Probe
			Parse Probe results to see if there is a match for process handler to run the process script:  https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/geneva-it-operations-management/page/product/discovery/concept/c_ProcessClassificationWorkflow.html
