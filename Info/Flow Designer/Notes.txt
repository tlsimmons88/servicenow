FLOWS
Flows consist of triggers and actions
	Trigger - when to run
Types of  Flows
	Record
	Schedule 
	
Flow process
	Trigger is hit
	System creates entry in the event queue
	Schedule processes the event and starts the flow in the background
	System build a process plan from the flow
	System runs the plan on the record that triggered the flow
	System stores the execution details in a context record 
	
Flow life cycle
	New/Modified
		Save it
	Flow is in Draft mode
		Activate it
	Are Actions published?
		If yes
			Flow activates
		If no
			Publish actions
			Then
				Flow activates

ACTIONS
Actions are globally shared and can be used by more than 1 flow.  If you update an action all flows that use it will be updated (think of it like a public method)

Actions can be in two states:
	Draft
	Published
	
Things you can do with an action
	Save
		Puts action in draft mode.  To see actions in draft mode "Show Draft Actions" must be turned on
	Publish
		Turns on the updated action for flows to use
		
Action Life Cycle
	New/Modified
		Save it
	Draft Action
		Publish it
	Published Actions
	
TRIGGERS
Run Trigger Options (only visible is trigger is create or updated  OR updated) 
	Once
	Always
	
	
DATA PILLS
Each time you add an action to a flow, Flow Designer adds a data pill to store its results.
Can use those results as inputs to other actions
Follows system driven naming convention

Warning:  Data pills populate as soon as data is available not when they are hit in the process of the flow


DEV WORK FLOW
To Test before publishing set Show Draft Actions to true
When dev complete and ready to publish do the following:
	Publish each action
	Set Show Draft Action to false
	Publish Flow

	
Tables
	Action status table
		sys_hub_action_type_definition

System Properties
	To change the limit of how many actions can be in a flow (default 20)
		sn_flow_designer.max_actions
